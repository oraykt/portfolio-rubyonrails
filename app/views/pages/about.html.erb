        I am a self-motivated and ambitious software developer who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills in web architecture and an academic background in engineering.
        My passion makes me an astute problem-solver capable of prioritizing and managing complex projects with proficiency.

        In my postgraduate studies, I've taken the lead for team projects and trained myself to be a good team leader.
        In my previous role, I exercised skills in communication and teamwork. As a team player, I feel confident and effective in collaborative work. I enjoy brainstorming to achieve a common goal.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        I am open-minded on new developments in my field.
